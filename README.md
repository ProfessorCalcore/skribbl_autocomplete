Typing 'amazing' likes a drawing
Typing 'trash' dislikes a drawing

Anyone can force you to like or dislike a drawing if they know the key terms!

# Features include:
1) Word suggestions: Enables quick typing by allowing you to paste the remainder of the word. For example if you type 'xy' then the word 'xylophone' will pop up. This copies 'lophone' to the clipboard. Then ofc you just do ctrl + v to paste it in. By using a third party keyboard shortcup remapper such as AutoHotkey this method is much more effective!

3) Like/Dislike Commands

4) Larger text displayed on top!
